# 100 Days, 100 Codes Challenge üöÄ

Welcome to my personal coding journey! This repository documents my commitment to the **#100DaysOfCode** challenge. For 100 consecutive days, I will be creating a new project, exploring a new concept, or solving a coding problem. The projects will range from simple Python scripts to more complex applications involving AI, data science, and web development.

The goal is to build a consistent coding habit, learn new technologies, and create a portfolio of 100 unique projects.

## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è

This challenge will primarily use the following technologies, but may expand as I explore new topics:
* **Language:** Python
* **Key Libraries:** `openai`, `pytorch`, `langchain`, `scikit-learn`, `fastapi`, `tensorflow`, `huggingface`
* **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, Git & GitHub
* **APIs:** OpenAI/Metis AI, and various other web APIs.

## How to Run the Code

Most projects in this repository are self-contained in their respective day folders. To run them, follow these general steps:

### 1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Navid-Ziaei/Challange-100Days.git](https://github.com/Navid-Ziaei/Challange-100Days.git)
cd 100-days-100-codes
```

### 2. Navigate to a Project Folder
```bash
cd Day1-Function-Call/
```

### 3. Create a Virtual Environment
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies for each project.

```bash

# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install Dependencies
Each project folder should contain a requirements.txt file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Set Up Environment Variables
For projects that require API keys or other secrets, you will need to create a .env file. A sample .env.example file will be provided.

```bash
API_KEY="your_secret_api_key_here"
```

### 6. Run the Script or Notebook

```bash
python your_script_name.py
# or
jupyter notebook your_notebook_name.ipynb
```
